### asd client - the lightest client for Twitch chat
This client works completely in Command line

I wrote really quick in two nights and I know it needs a lot of work and other features implemented - it'll be continued FeelsOkayMan

### How to get it running
##### Requrements
 - node.js
 - Twitch account 4Head

##### Installation
1. Download and extract this repository.
2. Open it's catalog in terminal, run `npm i`
3. Start it with `node .`

### Extra notices
 - The client saves login data in `./accounts` catalog, just delete those accounts manually if you want to get rid of those.
 - If someone interrupts your typing in chat, it is not lost, don't worry
 - After connecting, use `//join` to join a channel - only one channel can be handled at max for now.
 - Whenever you're stuck, just type `//exit` to get back or hit `Ctrl + C` to end a process directly.
